# Logstash Jetstream Plugin

This plugin enables key/value lookup enrichment against a NATS Jetstream storage.
You can use this plugin to query for a value, and set it if not found.

# Usage

    jetstream {
      hosts => ["nats://logstash:logstash@server.domain.ru:4222"]
      bucket => "test_tags"
      get => {
        "test_tag" => "[cache_tag]"
      }
      add_tag => ["from_cache"]
      id => "jetstream-get"
      tls_certificate => "/usr/share/logstash/config/cas.crt"
      tls_enabled => true
    }


    jetstream {
      hosts => ["nats://logstash:logstash@server.domain.ru:4222"]
      bucket => "test_tags"
      set => {
        "[host][address]" => "%{[host][address]}"
      }
      add_tag => ["to_cache"]
      id => "jetstream-set"
      tls_certificate => "/usr/share/logstash/config/cas.crt"
      tls_enabled => true
    }
